# Building-insurance-claim-prediction
A key challenge for the insurance industry is to charge each customer an appropriate premium for the risk they represent. The ability to predict a correct claim amount has a significant impact on insurer's management decisions and financial statements. Predicting the cost of claims in an insurance company is a real-life problem that needs to be solved in a more accurate and automated way. Here we will solve the insurance claim prediction for the building. It is based on a knowledge-based challenge posted on the Zindi platform based on the Olusola Insurance Company. The Company offers building insurance that protects against damages caused by fire or vandalism. In this project, we will build a predictive model that determines if a building will have an insurance claim during a certain period or not.
